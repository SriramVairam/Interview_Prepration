
Spring Boot is a Java framework that makes it easier to create and run Java applications. 
It simplifies the configuration and setup process, allowing developers to focus more on writing code for their applications.


Why Use Spring Boot?

Auto Configuration
Standalone Applications
Speeds up development.
Eliminates the need for complex XML configurations.
Provides an opinionated way to build Spring applications.

Example of a Simple Spring Boot Application:

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MySpringBootApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MySpringBootApp.class, args);
    }
}

What is a Servlet?

A Servlet is a Java class used to handle HTTP requests and responses in a Java web application. It runs on a web server 
(like Apache Tomcat) and helps generate dynamic web pages by processing client requests (usually from a browser). 
Servlets are part of Java EE (Jakarta EE) and extend the HttpServlet class to interact with the web.
